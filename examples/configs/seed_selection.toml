# QBench Seed Selection Configuration
#
# This demonstrates how to select specific scenarios and seeds for testing.
# Useful for:
# - Testing reproducibility with specific seeds
# - Focusing on particular challenge types
# - Quick validation during development
#
# Run with: qbench eval --config examples/configs/seed_selection.toml

[evaluation]
# Test only 3 specific scenario types
scenarios = [
    "backlog_cap_stability_guard",
    "cold_start_to_surge",
    "urgent_flood"
]

# Use only seed 1 for faster testing
# Each scenario has 3 seed variants - this runs 3 scenarios × 1 seed = 3 episodes
seeds = [1]

# Parallel execution is fine with fewer episodes

verbose = true  # Show detailed logs for debugging
quiet = false

# Notes:
# - Seeds are numbered 1, 2, 3 (corresponding to seed_1.json, seed_2.json, seed_3.json)
# - You can specify seeds as: [1], [1,2], or [1,2,3]
# - Scenario names can be:
#     - Full names: "backlog_cap_stability_guard"
#     - Partial matches: "backlog_cap" (must be unique)
#     - First N: "5" (runs first 5 scenarios)
#     - Range: "1-10" (runs scenarios 1 through 10)
